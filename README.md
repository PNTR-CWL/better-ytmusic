## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Download the `style.css` file.
2. Go to:  
   `Options → Visual Tweaks → Theme → Import custom CSS file → Select the downloaded file`.
   


I also recommend using my `config.json`

📁 **Place the file in this localization:**


`%appdata%\YouTube Music`
or
`C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\YouTube Music`

Both files can be downloaded from:
`code (more frequent updates)`
or 
`releases tab (bigger updates)`
