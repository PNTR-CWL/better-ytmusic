## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Download the `style.css` file.
2. Go to:  
   `Options → Visual Tweaks → Theme → Import custom CSS file → Select the downloaded file`.
   


I also recommend using my [config.json](https://github.com/PNTR-CWL/better-ytmusic/blob/38571496b7aca607944be2f17233ed16b2071f60/config.json).

📁 **Place the file in this localization:**

<pre>
Windows:
%appdata%\YouTube Music

Full path example:
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\YouTube Music
</pre>

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- All sliders (progress and volume) are rounded based on the current percentage. (and i don't really know how to fix this)
